Thanks for your purchase of Horizon[ON].

The included example scene is set up for linear color space, please set the color space to linear in the player settings or the example scene will look too bright. 

To make it possible to update the manual quickly without having to resubmit Horizon[ON] to the Unity Assetstore i provide the documentation as a download from Dropbox instead of including it in the package itself.

Please visit the forum thread to get the latest version of the manual(you can find it in the first post).

Alternatively you can also get the manual from the Assetstore page of Horizon[ON].
