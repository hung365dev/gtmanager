/*
This folder contains NGUI 3.x integration files for the Dialogue System.

The sub-folders are:

- Example: An example scene using an NGUI bark UI, dialogue UI, 
  quest log window, and selector.
- Prefabs: Various dialogue UIs built using the NGUI Dialogue UI system.
- Scripts/NGUI Bark UI: Implements a bark UI using NGUI.
- Scripts/NGUI Dialogue UI: Implements the dialogue UI system using NGUI.
- Scripts/NGUI Quest Log Window: Implements AbstractQuestLogWindow using NGUI.
- Scripts/Miscellaneous: Miscellaneous scripts.
- Scripts/Editor: Adds menu items to Window > Dialogue System > Component > UI > NGUI.


Note:
Most of the prefabs were built in an earlier version of NGUI 3.0. While they
work as-is, the current version of NGUI has difficulty editing them. The
"Basic NGUI Dialogue UI" and "Basic NGUI Dialogue UI with Continue Button"
prefabs have been re-built in NGUI 3.5.9 to be compatible with NGUI's new 
editing method. Use this prefab as a model for studying and customizing NGUI
dialogue UIs.


See the documentation for more information.
